Question 1:

<close> - <open> gives you the gain
dividing it by <open> and multiplying it by 100 gives you the percentage gain


Question 2:

create a procedure with two inputs start date (YYYY MM DD) and start time(HH MM SS)
merge two inputs and cast it to datetime
add 5 hours to the datetime 
find the rows between this time interval
then calculate the sum(trade_size*trade_price)/sum(trade_price) grouping it by ticker name


Question 3:

PriceDiff Table: select a table which has first trade of the day and its opening price
select another table which has last trade of the day and its closing price
then join these two tables and get the absolute difference between the extracted values
then sort the table by price range in descending order and pick the top 3 dates.

High Table: select a table with maximum price value for each date
join the table with itself to find the timee at which the max price was reached

Then join the pricediff and high table with matching Dates.
